A couple of quick updates on the driver.  Some of this is in my prior post, but it seems that not everyone gets to the end of that :)

It supports a whole bunch of Sony cameras, at the time of writing the list has 24 models on it, and I've just had someone confirm that the α1 works.

Adding new cameras is super easy, just run the provided utility and email me what it prints out - as soon as you have done that I can add the camera definition to the next version (and the list).

It supports both 32 and 64-bit versions of applications.

It can adjust both the exposure time and ISO settings on the camera, allowing very accurate timing for bias and flat images.

If you are using APT, the camera's LiveView feature can be engaged.

Full details about the known supported cameras and applications, as well as installation, troubleshooting, and configuration can be found on the Wiki page.

Thank You!

I'd like to extend a huge thank-you to those people who have submitted camera profile information.  By doing this you're making the driver more accessible to users in the future, as their cameras will now work "out of the box".
