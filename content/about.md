title: In the beginning...
---
I never had a Commodore Pet - in fact I've never had any machine made by Commodore.  However, a sighting of a Pet in the Math department Head's office was all I needed to become fascinated with computers.

Here, I hope to list all of the various computers I owned from earliest up until the machines I have collected over the past few years.

Hopefully it is of some historical interest to someone out there :)
