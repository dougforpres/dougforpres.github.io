Hi, I'm Doug.

My introduction to computers was in 1980 - spotting a Commodore PET in my High School Math teachers office. From there I got my first computer in 1981 and I've been writing software since.

This is the place where I share my thoughts and notes about things that I'm
excited about and working on and hope to connect with people having a similar
mindset. I'd love to hear from you!
