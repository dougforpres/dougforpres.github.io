My most recent project - it started off as me trying to find a solution for a problem, and has since taken off.

It seems there are many folk around the world with Sony cameras who would just love to have a tool that lets them take photos of the night sky.

From initial support for just one camera (mine) it now supports over 30 models of Sony Digital camera.

See the various [blog](/blog) posts and the [Wiki](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki) set up on the project page at GitHub.
